Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter who lived from 1853 to 1890. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists in history, despite never achieving fame or success during his lifetime.

Born in the Netherlands, van Gogh initially pursued a career in the art trade before deciding to become an artist himself. He struggled to find his voice as a painter, experimenting with a variety of styles before eventually settling on his signature style of bold colors and thick, expressive brushstrokes.

Despite his artistic talents, van Gogh struggled with mental health issues throughout his life, which were exacerbated by his personal and financial struggles. He famously cut off his own ear during a bout of severe depression and was institutionalized several times.

Van Gogh's most famous works include "The Starry Night," "Sunflowers," and "Irises." Today, his paintings are celebrated for their raw emotional power and innovative use of color and form.

Van Gogh died at the age of 37, by his own hand. Despite his tragic end, his legacy lives on as one of the most significant and enduring contributions to the art world.
